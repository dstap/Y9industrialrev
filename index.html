    <h3 class="h3"><b><u>Social</u></b></h3>
    
    <p class="leftp">Prior to the industrial revolution, the people of Great Britain itself were experiencing the agricultural revolution. All unwealthy citizens of Great Britain didn’t live in urbanised homes but rather rural cottages, they often worked as hired labour or sought employment in town. Labourers were adults and children alike. Additionally, jobs were mostly seasonal and peasants who sought education for their child were unable to receive it unlike children who were a part of a wealthy family and could be privately tutored. Girls in general were excluded from education until after the age of 7 - very specific. Most peasants lived this social lifestyle as well as merchants and their earnings fluctuated negatively at some points “The advent of industrial development revamped patterns of human settlement, labour, and family life. The changes set in motion by industrialization ushered Europe, the United States of America, and much of the world into the modern era..”<br><a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life">(Nat Geo) Industrialisation, Labour and Life </a></p>

    <h3 class="h3"><b><u>Political</u></b></h3>

    <p class="rightp">During the industrial revolution politics did not change much, with Britain still relying on a similar hierarchy system today however during this time Britain was an empire which lasted until 1997. Before the industrial revolution there were no taxes with taxes only being introduced to Britain in 1799. With King George III and Queen Victoria ruling before and during the industrial revolution, as well as having 22 different Prime Ministers during this time. Additionally there were no existing civil rights to protect labourers of any type “The role of Parliament in these complex developments was often crucial, and a great deal of regulatory legislation was put in place.”<br><a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/tradeindustry/industrycommunity/overview/earlyindustry/">Parliament.Uk</a></p>

    <p class="leftp">Before the industrial revolution, the overall way of life was differential and similar in certain aspects. People still lived amongst each other but rarely left their medium-sized villages in the “British isles” and the simple individuals led “agrarian lifestyles”. Culturally, peasants also practised subsistence farming as their ancestors did to meet basic living standards, this was practised amongst the community.<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life">(Nat Geo) Industrialisation, Labour and Life </a></p>

<h3 class="h3"><b><u>Economic</u></b></h3>

<p class="rightp">Prior to the industrial revolution, Britain relied a lot on farming and artisan crafts(a trade where one often uses their hands to make things). There was not a lot of trading before the revolution and because of this people often relied on others in their community for food and other supplies. Communities would have to work together and share out the jobs depending on what they need with common jobs like farmers, bakers and butches for food and other jobs like blacksmiths, carpenter, leather workers and weavers(also know as textile workers).”  Before industrialization, when the most significant economic activities in most European countries were small-scale farming and artisan handicrafts, social structures remained essentially as they had been during the Middle Ages.” <br><a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life">(Nat Geo) Industrialisation, Labour and Life </a></p>

Soon, this engine became England’s primary source of power for a vast array of jobs, most importantly; their presence in factories upheld mechanised factory production and Agriculturally, Steam engines were characterised as engines that were existent in the latter half of the eighteenth century nearing the 19th century as engines that could have their mechanically applied power to cultivate soil and be of use for threshing tasks; as well as processing grain. “It was then capable of grinding barley and pumping water”. “A few steam engines had been used on the farm as early as the 1790s”<a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/merl/nof/victorianfarming/show.php?start=1850&end=1890#:~:text=A%20few%20steam%20engines%20had,barns%20to%20drive%20threshing%20machines.&text=The%20characteristic%20steam%20engine%20for,field%2C%20from%20farm%20to%20farm">Reading.ac.uk - The Steam Engine in Farming.</a>.

However, towards the end of The Industrial revolution, Steam Locomotives introduced the standardisation of time and was a form of transport that made travelling from metropolitan areas to rural areas easier throughout regions on the European continent. This mode of transport had become another important aspect of the industrial revolution as a form of  expansion too. “Railroads were invented and opened up a whole new world of transportation- High-pressure steam engines also powered railroad locomotives, which operated in Britain after 1825. Railways spread rapidly across Europe and North America, extending to Asia in the latter half of the 19th century.” -<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrial-revolution-and-technology"> National Geographic Society.</a></p>

                    Newcomen’s Steam engine brought about efficiency in mines, this steam power was first applied to pump water out of coal mines to thoroughly empty coal seams of water to eliminate danger and dangerous labour to miners. Though this machine was incredibly inefficient and limited in terms of capabilities. Later however, this was utilised in factories, workplaces and were integrated into Steam-locomotives as well as factory grade machinery. This brought about efficiency and commenced England’s industrial revolution! It was then optimised by James Watt and Matthew Boulton, Watt’s engine achieved high levels of efficiency and mechanised European Industry in all aspects. This brought drastic economic growth to england and enabled larger enterprises to establish themselves “The steam engine turned the wheels of mechanised factory production. Its emergence freed manufacturers from the need to locate their factories on or near sources of water power. Large enterprises began to concentrate in rapidly growing industrial cities.”<br><a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrial-revolution-and-technology"> Industrial Revolution and Technology | National Geographic Society</a>

                <p class="rightp">“Water power was a more popular energy source for grinding grain and other types of mill work in most of preindustrial Europe. By the last quarter of the 18th century, however, thanks to the work of the Scottish engineer James Watt and his business partner Matthew Boulton, steam engines achieved a high level of efficiency and versatility in their design. They swiftly became the standard power supply for British, and, later, European industry”...  <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrial-revolution-and-technology">Industrial Revolution and Technology | National Geographic Society</a>
                    In terms of decline, the steam engine created less employment within factories as they increased productivity and the machines decreased the need for skill steadily. The machinery was also known to create fatal injuries and workers didn’t benefit from them at all. This integral aspect of the industrial revolution also prompted the extreme demand for coal which also degraded the environment and created unsafe work environments, forced labourers to work in factories such as the factories and mines; which had the risk of explosions despite whilst also prompting the production of goods and the contribution to the domestic system. So considering the Steam Engine’s permanent damage to society, most profoundly to the workplaces (mines/factories)in this way. It ultimately led to workplace laws being implemented and new, superior engines being used once invented.

                    <p class="rightp">Fair trade is the most trusted sustainability-label in the world, they ensures that through the production/manufacturing of a product, that it’s traded under genuine and legitimate circumstances and conditions. It changes the way it works through suitable prices, decent working and liveable conditions for workers in developing countries. More importantly, this global leader in this related movement ensures that individuals involved in such businesses are able to act and make decisions that influence the future of their business and product. This applies to textile-makers in this specific case and even agricultural workers (employers or employees).In general, a fairtrade product means that the decisions resulting in its production and selling have been enabled by positive, self and collective-sustaining decisions.“A product with the FAIRTRADE Mark means producers and businesses have met internationally agreed standards which have been independently certified. Farmers and workers have a strong voice at every level of Fairtrade, from how they invest in and run their local organisations to having an equal say in Fairtrade’s global decision-making.”<br><a href="https://www.fairtrade.net/about/what-is-fairtrade">Fairtrade.net - What is Fair-trade?</a>

                    <p class="leftp">
                        The benefits of fair trade to the producer means that more income is able to be made to ensure the high quality and quantity of a good which can be distributed thanks to the stable income created, this benefits the consumer through providing them with certified genuine products of sustainable origin. Also, In terms of the producer, they’re being benefited through being able to work in suitable conditions as legal labourers. Overall, Fairtrade’s ultimate Goal, which is to eliminate poverty and mutually benefits both the producer and consumer as it guarantees the output of quality and decently-priced products to corroborate with consumer satisfactory standards whilst simultaneously maintaining workable environments for employers and employees in all circumstances.

                            The countries that primarily export harvested bananas, obviously excluding the plants (both fresh and dried in forms of various species existent) are: Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, The Philippines, Belgium, the Netherlands, Guatemala, the US, Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Peru, France, Germany, Cambodia, Vietnam and Côte D’ivoire. An exception being that no nations in Oceania contribute to the international trade of bananas. All of these countries supply and produce the export of bananas.

                        <p class="leftp">
                            The evidence reinstating the fact that bananas are indeed a  fair-trade product where farms are present is supported on one of Fairtrade’s secondary informational sources which is a dashboard (seen above) which exhibits the “Development of Fairtrade area” (2016-2020), “Area under Fairtrade certification (2020)” and “Share of Fairtrade area by region 2020”. Secondly, there is also a bar graph shown in the second image which represents “Fairtrade area by country 2020” and lastly a graph stating “Fairtrade area growth by country” (2016-2020). Overall this dashboard which presents fairly relevant and interchangeable data from from statistics that are to soon be recorded essentially states that: 48,583 hectares of land hosting the commodity are fairtrade certified (those regions being Latin America, Africa, The Americas, Asia and Europe; where the stated nations are located). Additionally, Fairtrade area by country 2020 is measured as them; as an organisation having certified between 5,000-10,000 hectares throughout the rest of the world (excluding Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru). Lastly, the aforementioned countries have all experienced positive growth since 2016 which shows the impact created.

                        <p class="leftp">
                            Extra evidence of this existing product being fair-trade is the evident fact that every banana plantation worker will receive guaranteed base wage under jurisdiction of Fair-trade:

                            They state that through this certification strategy, the criteria of fair-trade can be met, which is to eliminate poverty and vulnerability for businesses and individuals through ensuring safe working conditions, the sustainability of their product to meet quality criteria and the fact that these people are being paid fairly. This will ensure that they are able to provide food, healthcare and schooling for themselves and their families to lead a liveable life. Overall, to be fair trade certified; the business needs to include requirements around: worker’s rights, fair labour practices and responsible land management. All this is exhibited through certified suppliers and exporters. All these international standards are met.
